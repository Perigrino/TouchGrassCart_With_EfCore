A repository that contains a  centralised storage facility that securely manages and organises items added by users for purchase or further consideration in an online shopping environment.
It functions as a virtual shopping cart, allowing users to browse a website, select products, and accumulate them in the cart repository until they are ready to proceed to checkout. 
The cart repository maintains the selected items, their quantities, and related details, ensuring a seamless and personalized shopping experience. 
It also supports features such as viewing item summaries, adjusting quantities, and removing items. 
By efficiently managing user-selected items, a cart repository enhances user convenience, simplifies the shopping process, and ultimately contributes to a smooth e-commerce transaction flow.
